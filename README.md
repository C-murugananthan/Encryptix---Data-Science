# Data Science Projects

This repository contains multiple data science projects, each aimed at solving different real-world problems using various machine learning techniques. Below are the details of each project:

## Projects Overview

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
2. **IMDB Movie Ratings Prediction**
3. **Iris Flower Classification and Prediction**
4. **Sales Prediction**
5. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**

## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

### Objective
Predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using information such as age, gender, class, and other relevant features.

### Dataset
The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

### Techniques
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.

### Usage
Run the notebook `titanic-prediction.ipynb` to see the analysis and prediction steps.

## 2. IMDB Movie Ratings Prediction

### Objective
Predict movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, and actors.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of movie information and ratings from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).

### Techniques
- Data Collection and Cleaning
- Feature Extraction
- Regression Models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.

### Usage
Run the notebook `movie-prediction.ipynb` to follow the steps for data processing and model building.

## 3. Iris Flower Classification and Prediction

### Objective
Classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

### Dataset
The Iris dataset is available in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

### Techniques
- Data Visualization
- Classification Models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.
- Model Evaluation

### Usage
Run the notebook 'iris-classification.ipynb` to explore the classification process.

## 4. Sales Prediction

### Objective
Predict future sales for a retail store based on historical sales data.

### Dataset
The dataset contains historical sales data for a retail store. It can be sourced from various platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

### Techniques
- Time Series Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Models: ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, etc.

### Usage
Run the notebook `sales-prediction.ipynb` to see the steps for forecasting future sales.

## 5. Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Objective
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction data.

### Dataset
The dataset is from a credit card company containing anonymized transaction details. Available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

### Techniques
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Imbalanced Data Handling
- Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- Model Evaluation

### Usage
Run the notebook `credit-card fraud detection.ipynb` to follow the process for fraud detection.
